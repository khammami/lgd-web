# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** November 21, 2024

Khalil Hammami ("us", "we", or "our") operates the Local Guides Directory (LGD) app and website (the "Service").

This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.

## **Information We Collect**

### Types of Information

We collect several different types of information for various purposes to improve our Service to you.

## **Personal Information**

While using our Service, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you ("Personal Information"). Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to:

* Email address (For account creation only)
* Full Name (For LGD profile)
* City (For LGD profile listing)
* Country (For LGD profile listing)
* Social Links: Google Maps profile, ~~Twitter~~ (optional), ~~Facebook~~ (optional)
* Precise Location (if you grant permission, primarily for features like displaying relevant local guides or for advertising purposes by third-party services like AdMob)

The data we collect depends on the features you choose to use. You can choose not to provide some information, but doing so may limit your ability to use certain Service features.

## **Sensitive Personal Information**

Depending on applicable privacy laws, certain data we collect may be considered "Sensitive Personal Information." Currently, this includes:

*   **Precise Geolocation Data:** As described above, if you grant permission, we and our third-party services may collect your precise location.

We collect and process this sensitive information only with your explicit consent (e.g., when you grant location permissions) or as necessary to provide the services you request and for the purposes outlined in this policy. You can withdraw your consent for the collection of precise geolocation data at any time by changing your device settings.

**Precise Location Data:**
Our Service may request access to your device's precise location. This information is used to:
*   Provide location-based features within the app, such as finding local guides near you.
*   Allow third-party services like AdMob to serve location-relevant advertisements.
You can control the collection of precise location data through your device's settings. Disabling location access for the app will prevent us from collecting this information directly, though third-party services might still infer approximate location based on other data like IP address. Please review the privacy policies of our third-party services for more details on their location data practices.

In addition to the information described above, we may collect your device identifier ("Device ID"). A Device ID is a unique identifier that is assigned to your device. We use Device ID to:

* Identify and troubleshoot bugs in the app.

We will not share your Device ID with third parties without your consent, except as necessary for the functioning of third-party services integrated into the app.

You can opt out of the collection of your Device ID by uninstalling the app. However, Device ID is essential for core app functionality and analytics.

## **Data Stored on Your Device**

The information you choose to enter in the app is stored locally on your device and is not directly collected by us.

## **Third-Party Services**

We utilize several third-party services that may collect information used to identify you. You can find the privacy policies of these services below:

* [Google Play Services](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US)
* [AdMob](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en)
* [Firebase Analytics](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy)

We use AdMob, a third-party advertising platform by Google, to display ads in our app. AdMob may personalize these ads based on your interests and activity in our app and other websites and apps.


* You can opt out of interest-based advertising by visiting your device settings and adjusting ad preferences. You can also visit[ https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/142293?hl=en](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/142293?hl=en) or[ https://youradchoices.com/control](https://youradchoices.com/control) for more information.

## **Log Data**

We collect information that your phone sends whenever you use our Service (Log Data). This Log Data may include information such as your device's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing our Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.

## **Cookies**

Cookies are files with small amounts of data that may include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to your browser from a website and stored on your device's internal memory.

Our Service does not explicitly use these "cookies." However, the app may use third-party code and libraries that use "cookies" to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our Service. Please have a look at the third-party service's privacy policy for information on their use of cookies.

## **Use of Information**

* Provide and improve the Service

* Understand how users interact with the Service
* Personalize the Service

## **Data Retention**

We will retain your Personal Information only for as long as necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will also retain and use Log Data for internal analysis purposes.

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.

## **Opting Out of Data Sale and Targeted Advertising**

**Sale of Personal Information:**

We appreciate your privacy and do not sell your personal information in the traditional sense (i.e., for monetary gain). However, some privacy laws like the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) have a broad definition of "sale" that may include sharing of personal information for targeted advertising.

**Targeted Advertising:**

We use AdMob, a third-party advertising platform by Google, to display ads in our app. AdMob may personalize these ads based on your interests and activity in our app and other websites and apps. This may be considered "sharing" or "sale" of data under certain privacy laws.

You can opt out of interest-based advertising through several methods:

*   **Device Settings:** Adjust your mobile device's ad preferences.
    *   For Android: Open "Settings" > "Google" > "Ads" and enable "Opt out of Ads Personalization."
    *   For iOS: Open "Settings" > "Privacy" > "Advertising" and enable "Limit Ad Tracking." (Note: Paths may vary slightly by OS version and device.)
*   **Industry Opt-Out Tools:** You can also visit industry opt-out pages like:
    *   [Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) Opt-Out Tool](https://youradchoices.com/control)
    *   [Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) Opt-Out Tool](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1)
    *   Google provides information on controlling your ad experience here: [https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/142293?hl=en](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/142293?hl=en)

Please note that opting out of targeted advertising does not mean you will no longer see ads; it means the ads you see may be less relevant to your interests.

## **Review Schedule**

This Privacy Policy will be reviewed annually or as needed to ensure it remains up-to-date with our practices and legal requirements.

## **Data Protection Officer (DPO)**

We have not appointed a formal Data Protection Officer. However, for any inquiries related to data protection and privacy, please contact our designated privacy contact person using the details provided in the "Data Controller" section.
